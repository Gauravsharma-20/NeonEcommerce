## Instructions to Run

This project was bootstrapped with [React Native CLI](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
In the project directory, run:

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 2: Start the Metro Server

To start Metro, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```bash
npm start
```

### Step 3: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its own terminal. Open a new terminal from the root of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your Android or iOS app:

#### For Android

```bash
npm run android
```

#### For iOS

```bash
npm run ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator shortly, provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.
